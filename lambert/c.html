          <b>Music<br><br></b>
          The music that was provided on the website was created and owned by TSA Alumni Joel Joseprabu.
          He gave us verbal permission to use his music for this project. 
          <br><br>
          His soundcloud page can be found at: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/joel-joseprabu">https://soundcloud.com/joel-joseprabu</a>.
          <br>
          
          <br><br><b>Images</b><br><br>
          Throughout this entire project, we have consistently used images/artwork from two different sources.
          <br><br>
          <i>Source 1:</i>
          <br><br>
          Our first source was from Joel Joseprabu in which we used his artwork, with his verbal permission, which is also publically posted on his soundcloud page.
          <br><br>
          His soundcloud page can be found at: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/joel-joseprabu">https://soundcloud.com/joel-joseprabu</a>.          
          <br><br>
          <i>Source 2:</i>
          <br><br>
          Most of the stock imagery was found from a website called Pexels. Pexels is a free-to-use stock image website with a large library of images. 
          This site can be found at <a href="https://pexels.com">https://pexels.com</a>.
